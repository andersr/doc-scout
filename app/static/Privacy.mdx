## What data do we collect or store?

### Note data

- All Note data is stored in your browser's local [IndexedDb](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) database.
- If You choose to enable note backups, a copy of your note data will also be stored in your Google Drive and transmitted using the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/reference/rest/v3).
- No note data is transmitted to any other server or third party.

### Google Drive Folder Id

- If You choose to enable backups of your notes to your Google drive, we create a folder on your Google Drive and store the id of that folder.
- The id is needed to back up your notes to the correct folder in your Google Drive.
- The id is stored in [Chrome storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage).

## Data protection mechanisms

- If You choose to enable backups of your notes to your Google Drive, we protect your data by using [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), submitting data using the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/reference/rest/v3), and by requesting an Auth Token from the [Chrome Identity API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/identity) each time data is transmitted.
- If you wish to revoke your approval of this access to Your drive, and clear any existing (cached) auth tokens, you can do so by disabling notes backup. (See Help for detailed instructions.)
